## 🚀 Key Features

- **JavaScript Event Handling:**  
  The page listens for various user events, such as button clicks, to trigger changes and provide a responsive user experience.

- **Interactive UI Components:**
  - **🌗 Light/Dark Mode Toggle:**  
    A button that dynamically changes the page's theme, adapting the background and text colors for better readability in different environments.
  - **❓ Collapsible FAQ Section:**  
    A set of questions that can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide the corresponding answers, improving content organization.
  - **📝 Custom Form Validation:**  
    The registration form includes custom JavaScript validation logic for the following fields:
    - **Name:** Checks if the field is empty.
    - **Email:** Validates for a correct email format using a regular expression.
    - **Password:** Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
    - **Confirm Password:** Checks that this field matches the password field.

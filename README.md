Interactive Web Pages Assignment
This project is a solution to an assignment focused on creating a dynamic and interactive web page using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal was to build a single-page application that responds to user actions, includes engaging UI components, and features robust form validation.

Key Features
JavaScript Event Handling: The page listens for various user events, such as button clicks, to trigger changes and provide a responsive user experience.

Interactive UI Components:

Light/Dark Mode Toggle: A button that dynamically changes the page's theme, adapting the background and text colors for better readability in different environments.

Collapsible FAQ Section: A set of questions that can be expanded or collapsed to show or hide the corresponding answers, improving content organization.

Custom Form Validation: The registration form includes custom JavaScript validation logic for the following fields:

Name: Checks if the field is empty.

Email: Validates for a correct email format using a regular expression.

Password: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.

Confirm Password: Checks that this field matches the password field.

How to Run
Save the files: Ensure you have the following three files saved in the same directory: index.html, style.css, and script.js.

Open in a browser: Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

File Structure
index.html: The main HTML file containing the structure of the web page, including the light/dark mode button, the FAQ section, and the registration form.

style.css: The stylesheet that provides the visual design for the page, including the light and dark mode themes, as well as the styling for the interactive elements and the form.

script.js: The JavaScript file that contains all the interactive logic, including event listeners, DOM manipulation, and the custom form validation functions.
